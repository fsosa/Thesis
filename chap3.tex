\chapter{Preliminary Work}

This chapter details the preliminary work that was performed prior to the developent of TaleBlazer Analytics. It expands on the process of arriving at the technical and design descisions that defined the scope of the thesis work and what TaleBlazer Analytics was to eventually become. 

\section{Key Decisions}

Prior to the start of the development of TaleBlazer Analytics (TA), many decisions had to be made in order to arrive at a feature specification for the TA system. In order to develop a useful analytics system, the types of analytics data to capture had to be determined. To meet the technical needs of the project, the technology used to build the new system had to be benchmarked and determined. Finally, the user interface for the TA web application was mocked up and underwent an iterative design process.

\subsection{Types of Analytics Data to Capture}

The key purpose of TaleBlazer Analytics is to capture metrics about TaleBlazer games. In order to achieve this, it was first necessary to determine exactly what kinds of data would be useful to capture and if we could capture it. First, preliminary work was performed in TaleBlazer Mobile to identify the types of information that TA was to collect through the development of an additional mobile tab dedicated to logging information. Second, a collaborative process was undertaken to arrive at a feature specification for the use cases of TaleBlazer Analytics users. 

\subsubsection{Log Tab}

The Log Tab is a new tab in TaleBlazer Mobile that was developed specifically to lay the foundation for the development of the TA system. This tab contains a chronologically-sorted list of game events that players can view in order to get a high-level picture of the actions they have taken during a gameplay session. A gameplay session consists of all the events taken from when a game is started to when it is ended, by restarting the game. The Log Tab contains information such as when a particular agent was bumped and if a player picked up certain items. 

The purpose of the Log Tab was two-fold. First, it served as a way to identify game events that would be useful to collect as data. If a particular event was deemed necessary to go in the log, then that type of data was prioritized to collect.
