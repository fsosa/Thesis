\section{Contributions}

Working closely with the TaleBlazer developer team, the following contributions have been made. First, key gameplay metrics were identified that would provide useful information regarding the performance of TaleBlazer games. Second, the TaleBlazer Analytics system was developed: a maintainable, scalable, and extensible system for the collection of gameplay metrics and the analysis and presentation of useful analytics data. Third, future improvements to TaleBlazer Analytics were identified and the groundwork laid in preparation for future development. 

\section{Conclusion}

TaleBlazer Analytics is an automated data collection system which seamlessly integrates with the existing TaleBlazer platform. The system is composed of an analytics server, client, and site. The analytics server is responsible for receiving, storing, and analyzing gameplay data. The analytics client integrates with TaleBlazer mobile to collect and send data to the analytics server. The analytics site provides useful and comprehensive analytics data for TaleBlazer games. The system is built to be maintainable, scalable, and extensible so as to accommodate future development and expansion. TaleBlazer Analytics will help game designers and researchers gain a better understanding of how players play TaleBlazer games and their educational impact.
