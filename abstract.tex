TaleBlazer is an augmented-reality platform that lets users create location-based games for their mobile devices. In order to determine the efficacy and use cases for TaleBlazer games, it is necessary to capture data about user behavior. This thesis presents TaleBlazer Analytics, an automated system which collects and analyzes mobile users' behavior in TaleBlazer games. It details the development of the TaleBlazer Analytics system, comprised of the backend data collection service and the front-end data analysis user interface.
